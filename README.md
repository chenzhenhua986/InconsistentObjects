# InconsistentObjects

This repository contains scripts for parsing labels of objects and object pairs of the InconsistentOjects dataset. The Dataset contains 182 videos from 9 actors. Each video contains either one or two actors, lasts around 5 seconds. If there are two actors, they talk to each other, otherwise, if there is only one actor, he or she will talk to the photographer. We switch the scenes by manipulating the viewpoints/distances of the camera or the background. For each scene, we create inconsistencies either by manipulating the actorsâ€™ wearing on their necklaces or wrists or by taking on/off some stickers from their upper arms.
